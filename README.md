Welcome to my Notebook ! If you are new at Machine learning and Wanna learn How to extract,plot and train models than you are at right place :)

Time to get our Hands Dirty :haha

The Notebook is comprised of few Section:

Section 1: Data Loading:
Loading the dataset and extracting out basic knowledge.

Section 2: Exploratory data analysis:
Plotting different attributes and their distribution. like below shows the distribution of target variable.

Section 3: Feature Engineering: 
I have used [Feature tools](https://www.featuretools.com/) for automatic feature engineering and I removed redundant/correlated features. Preprocessing like Imputation and Scaling is being done ;)

Section 4: Model Training and Selecting:

I tried different models like SVM,Random Forest etc. We compared all different models to see which works the best.

Section 5: Hyperparameter Optimization:

I used hyperopt with tree parzen estimator to find the best parameters. 

Enjoy !
